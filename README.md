# CS-3550-Theory-of-Networking-Security
Builds foundational knowledge in the theory and fundamentals of data communications, networking, security, and network programming. Topics include digital signaling and encoding, the OSI networking model, and TCP and IP networking protocols. The course also includes an introduction to networking security, attacks and defenses. Encryption and compression algorithms will be examined and implemented using a programming language. Students will learn how communication occurs between processes on machines located across a network by constructing and programming concurrent processes monitoring sockets and ports on different machines, to pass messages and data.
